Welcome to my GCP Professional Cloud Architect study notes.  I took and passed the test on 7/17/2020 and you can too!

The most useful data can be found here:  https://github.com/jerrycutshaw/gcp-professional-cloud-architect/blob/master/Jerrys%20Cloud%20Architect%20notes%20and%20tips.docx

I could clean up the notes a bit but then the get a little wordy and aren't as consolidated as one might need.  Study the material and look over it before tests and it will make perfect sense.
